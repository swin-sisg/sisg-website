						<h3>Industry Speaker event - Continuously Delivering Value At Zendesk</h3>
						<p>Presenter: <strong>Adel Smee - Team Lead at Zendesk</strong></p>
						<p>
							<em>"An Agile software development team needs to be good at one thing - responding to change. The mechanism of change is the software delivery system. By considering the technical, workflow and people elements of continuous delivery at the beginning of a project, rather than as an afterthought, you can ensure earlier competitive advantage.<br />
							At Zendesk we've built a continuous delivery pipeline to ensure we maximise our ability to deliver software of value at speed. This talk includes an overview of the technologies we use to build that pipeline, how we run it at web scale and why we chose this particular process. I'll also explain how we create an environment that fosters the intrinsic elements crucial for the success of this kind of software delivery: trust and collaboration".</em>

						<h3>Industry Speaker event - How To Pass A Job Interview Coding Test</h3>
						<p>Presenter: <strong>Adel Smee - Team Lead at Zendesk</strong></p>
						<p>
							<em>"If you're looking for a job as a software developer in Melbourne, the chances are you'll be asked to write some code to prove that you can do the job and do it well. I've read hundreds of these submissions and am sad to say that the standard is generally very low. Time and again I've seen a resume showing years of experience and/or excellent academic qualifications contrasted with a code test offering that doesnt even make it into the "Maybe" pile.<br />
							My experience is primarily in Agile-flavoured software development with flat hierarchies and cross-functional teams. This type of organisation ensures the people evaluating the coding tests are the same people you'll be working with, to ensure the appropriate technical standard is maintained. In this talk I'll explain what your prospective colleagues are looking for and what you can do to maximise your chances of getting to the next stage of the recruitment process".</em>
