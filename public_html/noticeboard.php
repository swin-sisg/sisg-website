				<h3>For Employers</h3>
				<p>SISG (www.sisg.com.au) comprises Swinburne students with IT skills in different areas and different skill levels. We invite organisations that have any IT requirements to recruit Swinburne students through SISG. Students may carry out part-time work, casual work, full-time work during holidays, project-based development, IT support, graphics design, coding of a module, develop a website, solving an IT issue or any  IT-related work. They can contribute to organisations and gain IT experience at the same time.</p>

				<p>In addition to the excellent IT education that Swinburne provides to its students, SISG provides best-practices and coaching through this program. For instance, we have a community to help each other, we have a knowledge base of best-practices, and experts in software development teams to help our students when they encounter technical issues.</p>

				</p>We invite organisations (for-profit and not-for-profit) to advertise jobs and assignments using this service. We expect for-profit organisations to provide a small reward to the students. The rate is up to individual organisations and depends on the scope of project. Our students will work directly with the organisation. We encourage our students to do voluntary work for not-for-profit organisations with a reasonable work scope. We advertise a job through SISG website and media channels. Student members can submit their resumes and bid for a job. The organisation can select the students according to their needs. If they need help or information from staff, assistance will be provided. Please contact us for more information.</p>
